1. Compiling the program
-----------------------------
Prior to compiling the program please save all three programs to the same directory. This 
means that Assign2.java, LinkedList.java, and Node.java must all be in the same folder.
Once opening a command line / terminal, make sure to cd into the correct directory.Then to
compile the files, use the following command in terminal:
javac Assign2.java Node.java LinkedList.java

2. Running the program
-----------------------------
Prior to running the program ensure you are still cd'd into the correct directory. Ensure
the input text file is in a sub-folder labeled "src". The class files and the src folder
should all be in the directory your terminal is in. Then, run the program with the following
command:
java Assign2 inputFileName outputFileName
Note: When using, replace the argument "inputFileName" with the appropriate text file name
that you are wishing to use. Then replace "outputFileName" with the desired name for the
output file. The extension .txt should not be included in the file names.
